The two projects were completed as assignments in an independent study class - Numerical Analysis,
they cover Individual methods on Integration and Differentiation and ODEs. However, the error terms were
not derived in the projects as they were derived during lecture and the class leaned more towards the applications.

The pdfs were created out of interest for Numerical Differentiation and one way to derive the error.

The MATLAB code is a small portion of the projects that I have done for an independent study. I will add more later.
